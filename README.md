# Guardian Bot
A lemmy bot that deletes posts and comments that contain blacklisted links

## Notes
- If running on windows the environment variables may act up. You can insert them manually into the bot by replacing the things like process.env.USERNAME and the other things starting with process.env with the value for username in .env or their other respective value

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create an account in the instance you want the bot to have as its home (just make a regular user)
3. Create a file called .env in the bot folder and give it values in this format with the data in the quotes (dont add the slashes or the part after the slashes)
```
INSTANCE="" // The instance the bot account is in
USERNAME="" // The bot username
PASSWORD="" // The bot password
```
4. Change the data in config.yaml based on what you want set
5. Open a terminal in the bot folder and run `npm install` to install dependendies and then `node main.js` to run the bot (whenever you want to start the bot again you can just do ctrl+c to interrupt the process and node main.js to start the bot)

I recommend installing something like [forever.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) for making it run continually
