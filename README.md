# Guardian Bot
A lemmy bot that deletes posts and comments that contain blacklisted links

This bot requires mod permissions in any community you want to use it in

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create an account in the instance you want the bot to have as its home (just make a regular user)
3. Create a file called .env in the bot folder and give it values in this format with the data in the quotes (dont add the slashes or the part after the slashes)
```
LEMMY_INSTANCE="" // The instance the bot account is in
LEMMY_USERNAME="" // The bot username
LEMMY_PASSWORD="" // The bot password
```
4. Change the data in config.yaml based on what you want set
5. Open a terminal in the bot folder and run `npm install` to install dependendies and then `node main.js` to run the bot (whenever you want to start the bot again you can just do ctrl+c to interrupt the process and node main.js to start the bot)

I recommend installing something like [forever.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) for making it run continually
